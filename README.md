## What It Does

It's basically a digital birthday card that everyone can contribute to, but nobody can see until the birthday arrives.

**If you're organizing:**
- Set up a capsule with their name and the birthday date you want it to open
- Get a number or link to share with people
- Watch as people contribute (you can see the count, but not what they wrote)
- Optional: Add PINs if you want to control who can contribute

**If you're contributing:**
- Someone shares a number with you
- You add your birthday message, maybe a photo or some fun ASCII art
- Everything stays hidden until the birthday

**On the birthday:**
- Unlock everything with a password
- See all the messages together with some nice animations
- Download it all to keep forever

## How to Use It

1. Create a surprise capsule for someone's upcoming birthday
2. Share the capsule number with friends and family
3. Everyone adds their wishes (secretly!)
4. When the birthday comes, unlock it all at once

It's that simple.
